About
=====

__AndroidXRef__ in an independent project aimed to assist developers working with Android Internals.

The main focus of the project is to provide easy access to Android source code and the tools required to setup a similar environment in a local environment.

### Technical
The AOSP version of Android source code is provided online as a full cross-reference, which allows for fast code searching and browsing. The cross-reference includes full history of the files, so although some versions of Android are not available directly, they can be accessed using the History feature.

Currently only __Gingerbread__ and __Ice Cream Sandwich__ versions of android are available online and __Jelly Bean__ should be available not long after its source code release. Other versions of Android should be available in the future as the infrastructure of the project improves.

### Back-End
AndroidXRef is powered by OpenGrok, a project developed by the OpenSolaris team to generate source code cross-reference.
