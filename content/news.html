13/07 - New Server
-------------------

Awesome news! We just got a brand new dedicated server! =)
No more memory issues, no more HD issues (Or so I hope...)! This is much more expensive than our previous solution, but the change was needed.

I am moving the repos to the new server, starting with a brand new index of Android Jelly Bean (4.1). As soon as all the indexes are ready, I'm moving the website to the new server. The one in linode will remais for a while as a backup.

Hello Android Hackers,

We got a brand new Homepage for AndroidXRef project. I hope you like your new face. Do you have any suggestion about how it can be improved? Please, drop me an email. =)

27/06 - Sync issue with 4.0.4
-----------------------------

There was an issue with the 4.0.4 index that was pointing some references to the 2.3.6 branch. It was a side effect of some new index options I was trying in the server to optimize the index. The index was re-generated, so all those sync issues should be fixed.

13/06 - Indexes are back online
-------------------------------

After some downtime due to problems with our old provider, AndroidXRef is back online along with the cross-reference for Android 2.3.6 and 4.0.4.

10/06 - We are not gone!
------------------------
Dear Android Hacker, 

Fear not! AndroidXRef is not going anywhere. This is just another episode of our battle to keep android source code available for everybody. Our old host provider was sold to another company and the service was terminated without notice. 

I decided it is about time to put some extra bucks into the project, and I'm moving to Linode, which i expect to be more stable than the cheap hosts that were running AndroidXRef.

The index should be back online in a few days with some extra resources and now in Beta stage.

Thanks for all the support.

- Rodrigo Chiossi
